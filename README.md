## Built With

- Ruby on Rails

## Getting Started

The project works with the postgresql database
To test the endpoints locally you can use postman, insomia or a similar tool

- `git clone https://github.com/Davidosky007/tracking-api-rails.git`
- `cd tracking-api-rails`
- `bundle install`
- `rails db:create`
- `rails db:migrate`
- `rails db:seed` to populate the database

The authentication uses a environment variable to wotk. To set it up:

- `bundle exec figaro install`
In the `config/application.yml` file that will be created add:
- `SECRET: <your_secret>`

To run the tests:

- `bundle exec rspec`
